# <h2> Reviewer's comment</h2>
#     
# There's an introduction, which is good. It is important to write an introductory part, because it gives an idea about the content of the project.
#

# In[73]:

# In[74]:


# Replace column name to lowercase
data.columns = data.columns.str.lower()
data.columns


# #### Why were the datatypes changed?
# - The column of 'year_of_release' need to be changed from float64 to int32. This will save memory space and operational efficiency.
# - The 'user_score' needs to be changed from object to float64 to perform arithmetic operations.

# In[75]:


# Convert datatypes
# The 'year_of_release' should be in int as it does not require float, which will take more memory
data['year_of_release'] = data['year_of_release'].astype('Int32')

# The 'user_score' needs to be in float as it would require some statistical analysis (e.g. taking average of scores, etc. )
# The 'tbd' data can be converted to np.nan to allow for float data processing
data['user_score'] = data['user_score'].replace('tbd', np.nan)
data['user_score'] = data['user_score'].astype('float64')  # This can later be filled with mean/median per genre

#       The duplicates for the name-year-platform has been addressed. Found two duplicates. Assigned value to more populated duplicated row.

# #### Missing values
# 
# - The 'name' and 'genre' columns have 2 data with missing values. Critic score, User score, and rating are also missing for these 2 data points. It is reasonable to exclude these 2 data points as important information are missing.
# 
# - 269 games are missing year_of_release. Some games have year information. The year information can be extracted and imputed into the year_of_release column. year_of_release information was imputed in this way for 17 data points.

# #### Calculate the total sales (the sum of sales in all regions) for each game and put it in separate column

# In[92]:


# Total_sales is the sum of sales in all regions
# data['total_sales'] = data['na_sales'] + data['eu_sales'] + data['jp_sales'] + data['other_sales']
data['total_sales'] = data[['na_sales', 'eu_sales', 'jp_sales', 'other_sales']].sum(axis=1)
data[['name', 'na_sales', 'eu_sales', 'jp_sales', 'other_sales', 'total_sales']]


# #### Intermediary conclusion
# 
# - Initially, there were 11 columns, 'total_sales' was added to the data, which is the sum of sales in all the regions. The data is described below:
#     - name: name of the game (string, e.g., Wii Sports);
#     - platform: platform the game was released (string, e.g., Wii);
#     - year_of_release: year the game was release (string, e.g. 2009);
#     - genre: genre of the game (string, e.g., Sports);
#     - na_sales: game's sales in North America (float);
#     - eu_sales: game's sales in eErope (float);
#     - jp_sales: games' sales in Japan (float);
#     - other_sales: game's sales in other regions (float);
#     - critic_score: critic's ratings for the game out of 100 (float);
#     - user_score: user's ratings for the game out of 10 (float); and,
#     - rating: ESBR ratings (string).
#     
# 
# - Except for two values, no other values were duplicated. One was deleted as majority for information was missing and the other was considered split data, thus, the information of the duplicated rows were merged appropriately. 
# 
# - Data types were converted into appropriate datatypes. 
# 
# - The missing values for year_of_release of 17 games were extracted from game's name (e.g. Madden NFL 2004) and added to the year_of_release column with appropriate assumptions. 
# 
# - The critic's rating, user rating, and ESBR ratings have significant number of missing values. Possible reasons could be:
#     - niche or small-scales games may not attract a large audience or attention from critics;
#     - platform specific, for example, games release in smaller platform may not be widely reviewed;
#     - games may only be released in beta stages;
#     - games may have be of poor quality or incomplete;
#     - games may have limited release; and
#     - big platforms may not have user review features, e.g. Nintendo eShop does not offer user reviews.
# 
# 
# **Hypothesis:**: The information about the game platform, genre, year of release, critic ratings, user ratings, and ESBR ratings are good indicators whree a game is going to be popular, successful, and profitable.

# Is it a good idea to consider more than 20 years? Market is dynamic, everything is changing. Some popular genre may not remain popular 10 years later, not to mention 20 years. And vice versa. During this time, several platform generations will change :) The industry is evolving, the games are getting better, the graphics is getting better and the users are getting more demanding. In such tasks, we need fresh information, fresh estimation. If we forecast for 2017, then who cares what happened 10-20 years ago?  Potentially profitable platforms can be easily selected with charts and pivot tables, but user portraits may change. If you look at the sales bar chart (in the very beginning of this part), you will see in which year the market stabilized after huge volume sales. We can also take the half of a lifetime period.

# If we look at the very first sales chart, we will see in which year the market stabilized after huge volume sales. Let's adjust this choice and take years from 2012 or 2013. Years before 2012 (here you include 2011) have huge sales volume, which can influence our distributions. Moreover, new platforms appeared in 2012-2013, which means that these huge sales were generated by older platforms that cannot be relevant for so many years.

# #### Which platforms are leading in sales? Which ones are growing and shrinking? Select several potentially profitable platforms.

# - The scatter plot of Critics and User score vs Global sales shows that there is an lack of strong correlations, which is further verified by low Pearson correlation values.
# - Spearman and Kendall correlation, suitable for ordinal data, are also shown below. Both evaluation methods show low correlations. 
# - High volume global sales PS2 games have user score > 8 and critic score > 8.5.

# ##### Conclusion of PS4 platform: 
# - All three correlation metrics show low-correlation between the critics and users scores to the global sales. 
# - Generally, low critics and user scores have low global sales. 
# - However, high critics and scores do not necessarily assure high-global sales.
# - Only few games with relatively higher critics and user scores have high global sales.
# - Critics score is positively correlated to global sales, while user score is not a good indicator of a game's profitability.

# ### Analysis of correlation of Critics and User scores to global sales for:
# **Xbox 360:**
# - All correlation metrics for X360 are low, except for Spearman correlation for critics score, which is reasonably high, 0.63. 
# - Games with higher global sales tend to have higher critics scores. However, some of these games have low-user scores. 
# 
# **PS3:**
# - Similar trends are observed for PS3 as X360.
# - Spearman correlation for critics score is relatively high, 0.59.
# - Games with higher global sales tend to have higher critics scores. However, some of these games have low-user scores. 
# 
# **Overall correlation conclusion**
# - The PS4, X360, and PS3 platforms show generally low Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations. 
# - The critics score is more correlated to the global sales compared to user score. Therefore, critics score can be used to modell 2017 sales than user score.
# - In general, games with low user and critics score tend to have low-global sales.
# - However, not all high-score games have high-global sales, but high-global sales tend to have high scores. There are only few (5 games) that do not adhere to this conclusion, especially for X360 and PS3 platforms.

# #### General distribution of games by genre
# 
# What can you say about the most profitable genres?
# - The most profitable genres are action, sports, and shooter games. These tend to be active and dynamics games. I believe these have multiplayer games, which makes then attractive to large user base.
# 
# 
# 
# What can you generalize about genres with high and low sales?
# - There is a different of a factor for high- and low-sales genre, i.e, action and strategy, respectively. 
# - Apart from action, sports and shooter have global sales in billion. These games tend to be more dynamic, active, and most likely multiplayer games. 
# - In contrast, the three low-sales genres are puzzle, adventure, and strategy, in decreasing order, tend to be much slower paced, single player, methodological, and more celebral. Although, there may be multiplayer games, especially, in adventure games, a distinct nature of story arc elements.

# ### Conclusions on market shares by platforms in different regions
# - All three - NA, EU, and JP - markets are very different.
# 
# 
# - X360, PS3, PS4, XOne, and 3DS are the most popular platforms in NA, while EU markets are dominated by PS3, PS4, X360, 3DS, and PC. 
# 
# 
# - Meanwhile, Japanese market is dominated by handheld platforms like 3DS, PS3, PSP, PSV, and PS4. Xbox has has 0.36% of Japanese market.  
# 
# 
# - The maximum market share by a particular platform is 41% - 3DS in JP)
# 
# 
# - The console platforms are competitive in NA and EU.

#     Conclusion on Genre Market Share
#     
#     - The Japanese gaming market is significantly different from the american and european markets, with role-playing genres capturing approximately a third of the market. 
#     
#     - Meanwhile, the North American and European markets are similar in terms of top four most popular genres, i.e., Action, Shotter, Sports, and Role-Playing genres. Additionally, their market share are almost identical. 
#     
#     - Action genre does capture a significant amount Japanese market as well.

# <h2> Reviewer's comment 5 </h2>
# 
#     
# There are some similiarities between Europe the Northern America, while  people in Japan prefer portable platforms and japanese market. We definitely should not recommend them XBox :)  In addition, Japanese also don't like shooters as much as in NA and EU people do.

# 
# - There are 617 games with E rating, 456 with E10+ rating, 623 with M rating, and 616 with T rating. The rest of the rating include only small number of games. Therefore, not included in this conclusion.
# 
# - NA and EY sales trends for different ratings, but with higher mean sales. This is also apparent in the box plot analysis. 
# 
# - Again, the JP sales for differnt ratings trends and distribution are different compared to NA and EU sales. 
# 
# - From earlier analysis of market share, it is shown that the JP market are differnt than of NA and EU. THe ESBR ratings for differnt genre and platform can significantly affect the regional sales.

# Good. The null hypothesis always includes the equal sign. This is because the test does not understand exactly how we set the problem: we can say, for instance, let's make sure that they are not equal. Or that they are equal. And regardless of the purpose of our study, we always put equality at null hypothesis. Then the test result is interpreted correctly.

# The fact that we reject the null hypothesis does not entail that the 2nd hypothesis is true. We just reject it at a particular significance level. I would change the wording in the conclusion.

# # Overall Conclusion
# 
# - **Regional Conclusion**
#     - The JP market is considerably different than NA and EU markets.
#     - NA and EU gamers prefer X360, PS2, PS3, and Wii platfroms, but JP gamers prefer handheld Nintendo platforms
#     - JP games overwhelmingly prefer role-playing genre, while NA and EU games prefer action, sports, and shooting games.
# 
# 
# - **Platform Conclusion**
#     - PS2 has the greatest total sales over all regions.
#     - PS2, X360, PS3, Wii, and DS are platforms with more that 600 Million sales are selected 
#     - The PC platform is considerably differnt from other gaming platforms as PC, in general, have usage more than gaming. Therefore, the longevity of PC for gaming has spanned since the first years of gaming in 1985 to 2016. 
#     - DS is also the interest platform, as it was one of the first platfoms created back in 1985 and revived in 2004 that made significant traction and became the top 5 platform with nearly 800 Mil sales.
#     - In recent years, the main platform are playstation, Xbox, nitento variant. These companies/platforms dominate the gaming markets. 
#     - Most promising platforms are PS4, X
# 
#   
# - **Genre Conclusion**
#     - The Japanese gaming market is significantly different from the american and european markets, with role-playing genres capturing approximately a third of the market. 
#     
#     - Meanwhile, the North American and European markets are similar in terms of top three most popular genres, i.e., Action, Sports, Shooting, and Racing. Additionally, their market share are almost identical. 
#     
#     - Action and sports genres do capture a significant amount Japanese market as well. But the shooter genre captures least amount of Japanese market.
#     - Action and Sports are most popular genres with more than 2000 games 
#     - Platform and shooter genre have higher average sales although they have relatively low number of games, especially for Platform platform. 
#     
#     
# - **Ratings Conclusion**
#     - Mature ratings have higher average sales for EU and NA
#     - Average sales for EU and NA for E, E10+, M and T are significantly higher than for JP
#     - NA and EU sales trends by ratings closely resemble each other with NA sales higher than EU sales for all ratings. 
#     
#     
#     
# - **Statistical Testing**
#     - Statistical testing of PC and Xbox One user ratings indicate that we failed to reject the null hypothesis, i.e., the user score distribution for Xbox One and PC games are equal within the statistical significance.  
#     - The statistical testing of Action and Sports genre user scores indicate that we can reject the null hypothesis, i.e., the average of the user score disctribution for Action and Sports genres are equal.
